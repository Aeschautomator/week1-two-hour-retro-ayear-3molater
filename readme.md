This file is a retro, as I teach my friend some HTML, and CSS, and introduce him into coding i decided to go back and to the same assignment i did the first week of school. I will be giving myself a hard cap time of 1 hr 45 mins to see how I can do compared to the end of week 1 of class first starting to code. that includes the time spent in GIt, and creting this readme!
